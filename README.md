# Renew my borrowed books

This is a python script that I wrote to renew all the books I borrowed from my college's library.

Every week I needed to check on the library's app if any books passed the due date and click on the "renew" button if it did.

The fact is that I always forgot to do that, so I was paying the library fines everyweek.

So, instead of spending some minutes setting up reminders on my cellphone, I decided to spend some hours writing this script that checks all my borrowed books and renews them when reached the due date :)

Then I setted up as a AWS Lambda script that runs the ``main.handler()`` function and now I will never pay the fines anymore!
